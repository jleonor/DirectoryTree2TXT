DONE:
- Remove .json from config names
- Rename should allow for renaming directly in the list box
- Restructure project for best practices and MVVM
- Add another shade of light grey for box borders and the line separator inside the panel
- fix spacing in main area so that the texts "Directory Tree" and "Select a folder" texts have the same spacing with their respective text boxes
- make ios style scroll bar (in terms of looks, but if possible, also make it so that they only show during scrolling)
- when the fill window button is clicked, it makes it fill the window and changes the icon (and vice versa)
- adjust the look of the minimise, fill window/go in smaller window, and close button look (ios look with the colours and icons as well)
- if in full window mode, if the nav bar is dragged, go to smaller window mode
- ideally we can store this code in a separate file that can be added to any project, and all we have to specify is the application name
- Add an option for "hide" alongside "ignore" in the exclusions table and adjust the config json accordingly
- "ignore" overwrites the show content setting and doesn't show the contents for that file or folder. The file or folder name does still appear in the tree.
- "hide" hides that file or folder from the directory tree
- ignore and hide are ticked by default when an entry is added
- entries with wildcards "*" should be accepted
- for example, if "*.bat" would mean that we either hide or ignore all .bat files
- remove white border around the exclusion table
- redesign remove button
- change ignore and hide checkboxes to radio buttons
- Add spacers between headers and center cell contents
- Disable resizing and reordering of columns
- hide table header and table title 

REMAINING:


- upon loading, the configuration panel should be closed
- if no config is selected (which it should be by default), i want to have a big circle + button instead in the lower half of the config panel
- the + button will show the layout if that makes sense so that a new configuration can be created
- the save button should be moved to the bottom part of the config panel
- in the top half of the config panel, we should add an "Edit" button, that loads the configuration into the lower half of the configuration panel
- when this button was used to load the lower half of the configuration panel, the save button overwrites the file
- when the + button was used to load the lower half of the configuration panel, the save button adds a random config file
- In the configuration panel lower half, I want to also add a text box for naming the configuration (optional, if not filled, it will be randomized)
- if there is no saved configuration, completely hide the top part of the configuration panel

- make the top part of the configuration panel and the bottom part of the configuration panel vertically expandable/collapsible with headers like "Saved Configurations" and "Current Configuration"
- Add animation for expanding, collapsing, and fading for + button interaction

- add a copy to clipboard button for the directory tree (same height as the "Directory Tree" text, just all the way on the right)

- Change the highlighting colour of file selection to white

- Additional options compact -> smaller indentations
- Pipes / No Pipes / Custom prefix for each file and folder only (not content)
- Indent content with files (ignores pipes to connect if enabled) true or false
- Move file contents to end of text

- Add line counter and character counter below the directory tree
- Add option to show line numbers
